Statistical Test Summary for EEG Dataset
=======================================

Run on file: features_table.csv

Significance level (alpha): 0.05

This suite runs the following tests and records the full hypothesis statements with results.

T-TEST (Welch's independent t-test):
  - H0: equal means between the two label groups (label_enc=0 vs label_enc=1).
  - H1: means differ.

Mann-Whitney U (non-parametric):
  - H0: distributions identical between the two label groups.
  - H1: distributions differ.

ANOVA (one-way):
  - H0: all group means are equal across the grouping variable (participants or topics).
  - H1: at least one group mean differs.

Pearson correlation / Point-biserial:
  - H0: correlation = 0 (no linear association).
  - H1: correlation != 0.

Logistic regression (multivariate):
  - H0: all coefficients (except intercept) are zero (no predictive relationship).
  - H1: at least one coefficient != 0.

Notes:
- Results with NaN p-values indicate the test couldn't be computed (e.g., insufficient data or constant series).
- FDR flags present in the CSV for t-tests and Mann-Whitney indicate BH-FDR adjusted rejections.
